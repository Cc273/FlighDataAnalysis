# FlighDataAnalysis
###Overview

This project, completed as part of CS 644: Introduction to Big Data, involves developing an Oozie workflow to process and analyze a large volume of flight data. The analysis aims to derive insights into airline on-time performance, average taxi times, and reasons for flight cancellations using Hadoop and Oozie on AWS VMs.
